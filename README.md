# Euler.Clojure

[Project Euler][euler] is a growing set of mathematical problems that are often
used as a playground in which to learn new programming languages. Currently,
I'm leaning [Clojure], and this project contains my Clojure-based solutions to
the problems of Project Euler.

Each directory contains two files:
  * `problem.txt` describing the problem to be solved;
  * `solution.clj` defining my solution in Clojure.
